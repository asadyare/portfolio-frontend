# Portfolio data

## `caseStudies.js`

- **`projectCategories`** — route segments under `/projects/:categoryId` (e.g. `aws-guardrail-projects`, `portfolio-projects`, `bank-app-projects`, `healthcare-app-projects`). Add a row when you introduce a new vertical. Lower `order` is listed first.
- Each case study has **`category`** (must match a category `id`) and **`slug`** (unique within that category; keep globally unique for clarity).
- **`createdAt`** — ISO 8601 UTC string matching the GitHub repository **`created_at`** (e.g. from `GET https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO`). Shown sitewide as “Repo created …”. Add this field for every new project.

URLs:

- `/projects` — hub
- `/projects/portfolio-projects` — list of portfolio case studies
- `/projects/portfolio-projects/my-slug` — one case study

Helpers: `projectCasePath(categoryId, slug)`, `getCaseStudiesByCategory`, `getCaseStudyByCategoryAndSlug`.

**Legacy:** `/projects/<old-slug-only>` redirects if `<old-slug-only>` matches a case study `slug`.

## `projectsList.js`

Featured projects derived from `caseStudies.js` (includes `caseStudyPath` for cards). Use `featured: true` only for items you want in that list.

The homepage **Core Projects** grid uses **`getHomePageCaseStudies()`**: all entries with **`featured: true`**, sorted by **`projectCategories`** `order` then `slug`. Set **`featured: false`** on a case study to hide it from the home grid only.
